            <br>
            <p class="wow fadeIn">I know you are not from IT field, nor you are studying Btech, You dont really know the process of developing a website. I also know that this might just be another website for you. I will surely keep this thing in mind, and will come up with new ideas :P </p>
            <br>
            <p class="wow fadeIn">But this website isn’t like every other.. Its new year day today, and all this is about a beautiful girl with whom I fell in love with. Who has those sparkling eyes whenever she laughs, whenever she looks at you wearing her pretty smile. Who knows every thing about you, cares for you more than herself. I know I have told you a million times before.. But I'll never ever miss a oppurtunity to say it, that Whenever I see you, my heart skips a beat. And in those skipped beats, I live the most.</p>

The year of ours, the year that made us two meet. I still remember our first mandir trip, Gosh, I know you were scared that day becuase you never saw me driving before then and you were very doubtfull. I was also making some mistakes while driving because yess that was my first long drive. And Yess, there was your fault too.. Anyone would make mistakes having such a pretty girl sitting next to him :P</p>
            <br>
            <p class="wow fadeIn">But you know what.. this year has been the most happening year. What all has happened this year. So many new things, and really so many. Your birthday trip, the first time we kissed. Our small evening meets in Delhi University. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="wow fadeIn">You know what.. I have that trust in you, in us.. that no matter what, how much bigger the problem will be, how much longer the fight will go.. We can deal with it, as long as we are together.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Yes, we have that thing.. Where we aren’t afraid to have another fight. Where we knew everything is gonna end beautifully and maybe that is one of the reason why our love grows after every time we fight.
