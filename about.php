		<p>
			I'm Akshat Jain, a Full Stack Developer & Software Programmer based in Delhi, India. I am pursuing Bachelors of Technology (Information Technology), currently in 8th semester from Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology affiliated to GGSIPU. I will be graduated by 2017 and can work as a full time employee by August 2017.

			<br />

			Over the course of graduation, I have worked upon wide range of technologies. My area of expertise includes android app development and web development.

			<br />

			However, I can also work in front-end development, database design and java based projects.

			<br />

			I have developed many small projects during my learning phase as I evolved understanding new technologies and trends. These helped me a lot in building my fast learning curve.

			<br />

			I am a true technology fan and It always fascinates me to dig deeper into the known ones or try new ones.

			<br />

			I feel that mere completion of task is not important as well as the task has to be done in most efficient and effective way.

			<br />

			Apart from my work, I enjoy casual photography with my smartphone, and watching movies. 

			<br />

			The sense of organizing things drive me, I tend to build proper strategy and road maps, be it my code, or my desk, I like it clean, organized and maintained.
